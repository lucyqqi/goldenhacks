## Inspiration: 
We wanted to improve accessibility to information for those struggling with language comprehension or are seeking accessibility accommodations. One of our teammates, after being a resident assistant (don) in noticed how some students felt demotivated from attending class and some international students were struggling adapting to life in Canada. Our features can assist anyone such as those with hearing disabilities, immigrants looking to improve language comprehension, etc. There are many reasons to use our service for inclusion, accessibility, and efficiency.

## What it does: 
eduscribe.ai is compatible with both textual and auditory transcripts. EDAI transcribes audio into text or takes existing text, analyzes it then translates it into a target language. The user can then summarize the transcript to improve their comprehension of the information.

## How we built it: 
Using full-stack development with various frameworks. eduscribe.ai relies on incorporating comprehensive API's and AI machine models in Python for back-end along with integrating web development in Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for UI web development on the front-end.

## Challenges we ran into: 
We initially tried to use Taipy however, some technical issues arose with some of our computers which made it difficult. Unbeknownst to us, we unfortunately also spent quite a bit of time debugging OS errors; When everyone uses a different OS, you spend time trying to figure out things like the difference between Ctrl and âŒ˜ key. We were able to re-evaluate our process to efficiently execute our goal.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We are very proud of our innovative idea that increases accessibility which pertains to important EDI concepts. Our integration of API's and AI models within the UI of our website makes our service very accessible and efficient. The website we made is very intuitive and aesthetically pleasing which makes user navigation a more pleasant experience.

## What we learned:

Following the software development process, we brainstormed innovative ideas within the framework of wanting to increase accessibility and EDI. We used Git very effectively as a collaborative tool to work on developing and debugging our code for full-stack development. Incorporating public API's within the backend is not something most of us were too familiar with so it was a great learning experience. The time constraint for this project was also new for most of us which definitely affected the workflow.

## What's next for eduscribe.ai:
We want to be able to convert videos to audio files to be transcribed and translated. We believe it would also be beneficial to further develop our databases and UX/UI to be more inclusive and accessible in order to reach a broader range of target demographics. It would also be great to expand our services to include more detailed features such as sentiment analysis.
